# Key Decisions

## 1. Pak'nSave first, expand later

Chose Pak'nSave as initial target because their mobile API is accessible (no auth walls beyond guest token). Other NZ supermarkets (New World, Woolworths) can be added by replicating the API pattern for their platforms.

## 2. Foodstuffs mobile API over website scraping

The Pak'nSave website is a Next.js app on Vercel with Cloudflare protection and a .NET backend (`CommonApi`). Direct website scraping is blocked. The mobile API (`api-prod.prod.fsniwaikato.kiwi`) has no Cloudflare and accepts guest tokens — far more reliable.

## 3. cloudscraper for website requests, plain requests for API

`cloudscraper` is used when hitting `paknsave.co.nz` (Cloudflare-protected). The mobile API domain has no Cloudflare, so `cloudscraper` works but isn't strictly necessary there. Both scripts use `cloudscraper` for consistency.

## 4. Guest token auth (no user accounts)

No login required — guest token obtained via POST with `{"banner": "PNS"}`. Token lasts 30 min and is auto-refreshed. Avoids needing to handle user credentials.

## 5. First/most-relevant result, not cheapest

Product search returns results sorted by relevance. Taking the cheapest would return pet food or bulk items for queries like "beef mince". Using `products[0]` gives the most practical match.

## 6. Hand-curated ingredient lists

21 dishes with manually defined ingredient lists. No NLP/LLM parsing because:
- Keeps the prototype simple and deterministic
- Avoids API costs or model dependencies
- Ingredient queries need to be specific to Pak'nSave's product naming

## 7. 5 km search radius

Auckland CBD has only 1 Pak'nSave within 5 km. East Auckland (Botany/Manukau) has 3. The 5 km default balances convenience with store coverage. Adjustable via `MAX_DISTANCE_KM`.

## 8. Pak'nSave Store data from __NEXT_DATA__ (single fetch)

All store data is now obtained from a single fetch of the `/store-finder` page's `__NEXT_DATA__`:
- **`contentstackStores`**: maps URL paths to store GUIDs (60 stores)
- **`store_finder.regionStoreGroupings`**: provides store name, address, and latitude/longitude

The two datasets are joined on the shared `url` field. This eliminated the need for both the separate homepage fetch and the Nominatim geocoding step.

## 9. Nominatim for Pak'nSave Store geocoding (retired)

Geocoding is no longer needed — the `/store-finder` page's `__NEXT_DATA__` includes latitude/longitude directly from the `contactDetails` field, with higher precision than Nominatim returns. The Nominatim rate limit (1 req/sec), dedicated `User-Agent`, and `time.sleep` delay were all removed.

## 10. Jupyter notebook as primary interface

Chosen for easy experimentation — user can edit inputs and re-run cells without touching the terminal. CLI (`prototype.py`) available as alternative.

## 11. API-based Woolworths store discovery
Woolworths store locations are manually identified via a discovered JSON API (`https://api.cdx.nz/site-location/api/v1/sites`). This replaces manual HTML inspection and provides complete, structured, and filterable store data.

## 12. Automated store discovery
Store locations are now fetched and converted to CSV automatically using `scripts/woolworths/Get_woolworths_store_API_data.py`. This approach provides complete coverage and allows for automated filtering based on distance.

## 13. Playwright headed scraping over direct API for Woolworths

Initial testing of `GET /api/v1/products?target=search&search=milk` returned `400 Header is missing or is invalid.` — the documented endpoint is not usable without a verified authenticated session context. Playwright (headed Chromium) can load the public search results page and read rendered prices from Angular shadow DOM (`product-stamp-grid > div.product-entry`). Headless mode is unstable due to Akamai, so headed mode with `--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled` is required. Successfully navigated to the Woolworths website and located the store selection dropdown.

**Update (resolved):** The `target=search` endpoint **does** work without authentication — the `400` was caused by a missing `x-requested-with: ??` header, not by missing session context. A single `GET /` seeds cookies, and the API can be called with `requests.Session`. Playwright is NOT needed at runtime for any API operation. The `cw-lrkswrdjp` cookie can be constructed from `extra1` in `woolworths_store_data.json` and injected into a `requests.Session` for per-store pricing. Playwright was only needed for the initial exploration/discovery phase.

## 14. Joined Woolworths store datasets via common ID

Successfully linked store names (from dropdown choices API) with latitude/longitude (from location API) using a common ID. This allows for accurate store identification and filtering by distance, resolving previous name-matching issues.

## 15. Direct Store Selection via URL
Chose to use `https://www.woolworths.co.nz/bookatimeslot/(hww-modal:change-pick-up-store)` to bypass complex dropdown navigation and directly trigger the store selection modal, enabling reliable automated store selection.

## 16. Jupyter/Windows Async Workaround
Use `subprocess.Popen` for scraping to bypass `NotImplementedError` in Jupyter's event loop (Windows Proactor policy conflict).

## 17. Robust Pathing
Use absolute path construction (`os.path.abspath`) with `__file__` or `os.getcwd()` for all file access, preventing `FileNotFoundError` in sub-scripts.

## 18. Woolworths API `x-requested-with: ??` header

The `GET /api/v1/products?target=search` endpoint requires the literal header `x-requested-with: ??` (or any non-empty string including `XMLHttpRequest`). Without this header, all API calls return HTTP 400. Discovered via black-box probing of the `/api/v1` surface + existing github repositories. This header was the sole blocker that previously made the API appear unusable.

## 19. Woolworths per-store pricing — cookie injection, not query params

`fulfilmentStoreId` and `pickupStoreId` query parameters on `/api/v1/products` are accepted (HTTP 200) but **do not change prices**. Per-store pricing is controlled by the `cw-lrkswrdjp` cookie, which encodes `dm-Pickup,f-{fulfilmentStoreId},a-{areaId},s-{site}`. The cookie can be constructed from `extra1` in `woolworths_store_data.json` (verified 3/3 stores). Different stores return different prices (e.g., Greymouth Milk 3L = $7.15, Glenfield = $7.33). The optimizer must search each ingredient at each nearby store with a fresh session per store.

## 20. `cw-lrkswrdjp` is the sole per-store cookie

Of the 67 cookies captured from Playwright, only `cw-lrkswrdjp` carries store context. The other 66 cookies (session_state, RT, Akamai, analytics, ads) were systematically isolated and proven irrelevant — injecting them alone does not change pricing. The full 67-cookie jar produces the same result as injecting just `cw-lrkswrdjp`. This was verified in `explore_woolworths_api_part2.py` (session_state-only and RT-only tests) and `explore_woolworths_api_part3.py` (cookie-only injection).

## 21. `extra1` in `woolworths_store_data.json` = `fulfilmentStoreId`

The `extra1` field from the CDX store locator API (`api.cdx.nz`) is the `fulfilmentStoreId` used in the `cw-lrkswrdjp` cookie. Verified across 3 stores:

| Store | extra1 | fulfilmentStoreId (from cookie) | Match |
|-------|--------|--------------------------------|-------|
| Greymouth | 9009 | 9009 | [OK] |
| Glenfield | 9443 | 9443 | [OK] |
| Birkenhead | 9101 | 9101 | [OK] |

This means Playwright is NOT needed even for initial mapping capture — the cookie can be constructed for all 183 stores directly from the data file. The `extra2` field is the `pickupAddressId` (different number).

## 22. Fresh session required per store

The server's `Set-Cookie` response from `GET /` overwrites any injected `cw-lrkswrdjp` cookie when reusing a `requests.Session`. Tested by injecting cookies for 3 Auckland stores into the same session — only the first store's context was respected. Creating a fresh session (new `GET /`) for each store fixes this. This is implemented in `woolworths_optimizer.py`.

## 23. `areaId` is optional in the cookie

The `a-{areaId}` field in `cw-lrkswrdjp` is not required for per-store pricing. Tested in `explore_woolworths_api_part3.py` Step 3c:
- `dm-Pickup,f-9009,a-0,s-38` works (areaId=0)
- `dm-Pickup,f-9009,a-224` works (no s-field)
- `dm-Pickup,f-9009` works (minimum viable)

The `areaId` is NOT available from any API endpoint and would require Playwright to capture per-store. Since it's optional, this is not a blocker.

## 24. `s-38` is constant across all tested stores

The `s-{site}` field in `cw-lrkswrdjp` is `38` for Greymouth, Glenfield, and Birkenhead. Safe to hardcode in cookie construction.

## 25. New World uses Foodstuffs mobile API with `banner: "MNW"`

New World is owned by Foodstuffs (same as Pak'nSave). The mobile API at `api-prod.prod.fsniwaikato.kiwi/prod` serves both banners — use `banner: "PNS"` for Pak'nSave and `banner: "MNW"` for New World. The User-Agent must match the banner: `PAKnSAVEApp/4.32.0` for Pak'nSave, `NewWorldApp/4.32.0` for New World. This means New World stores can be fetched with the same infrastructure as Pak'nSave, just with different banner and User-Agent values.

## 26. New World mobile API over Nominatim geocoding

The Foodstuffs mobile API (`GET /mobile/store/physical`) returns latitude/longitude directly for all 149 New World stores. This eliminates the need for Nominatim geocoding, which failed on 22 stores. The API also provides store UUIDs, banner info, click-and-collect/delivery flags, and opening hours — all in a single request. No rate limiting concerns.

## 27. New World Edge API — FULL product search works (Algolia-based)

The New World Edge API (`api-prod.newworld.co.nz/v1/edge/`) provides **complete functionality** for the meal cost optimizer:

### Store Listing
`GET /v1/edge/store` — Returns 148 stores with full details (id, name, address, coordinates, opening hours).

### Product Search — Two-Pass Pipeline
`POST /v1/edge/search/paginated/products` — Algolia-powered search with per-store pricing.

**Authentication**: Accepts JWT from either:
- Mobile API guest login (`api-prod.prod.fsniwaikato.kiwi/prod/mobile/user/login/guest`)
- Website session (`POST /api/user/get-current-user` on `www.newworld.co.nz` → cookie `fs-user-token`)

**Required headers**:
```
Authorization: Bearer {jwt}
access_token:  {jwt}
Origin:        https://www.newworld.co.nz
Referer:       https://www.newworld.co.nz/
```

**Required cookies for per-store pricing**:
```
eCom_STORE_ID: {store_id}
STORE_ID_V2:   {store_id}|False
Region:        NI (or SI)
```

**Request payload**:
```json
{
  "algoliaQuery": {"query": "milk"},
  "page": 0,
  "hitsPerPage": 20,
  "storeId": "{store_id}",
  "sortOrder": "PRICE_ASC"
}
```

**Valid sortOrder**: `PRICE_ASC`, `PRICE_DESC`

**Price extraction**:
- Regular: `singlePrice.price` (cents)
- Promo: `promotions[].rewardValue` where `bestPromotion: true` (cents)

### Categories
`GET /v1/edge/store/{store_id}/categories` — Returns category tree.

### Relevance Matching
**Algolia Index Endpoint**: `POST /v1/edge/search/products/query/index/products-index`

This is the **DEFAULT Algolia index** (relevance-sorted). Returns hits with `_highlightResult` containing `matchedWords` — explicit relevance matching!

```json
{
  "algoliaQuery": {"query": "beef mince"},
  "page": 0,
  "hitsPerPage": 20,
  "storeId": "{store_id}"
}
```

Response includes `_highlightResult`:
```json
{
  "_highlightResult": {
    "DisplayName": {"value": "NZ Premium <em>Beef</em> <em>Mince</em>", "matchedWords": ["beef", "mince"]},
    "category2AndBrand": {"value": "Beef <em>Mince</em> > Premium", "matchedWords": ["beef", "mince"]}
  }
}
```

Only `products-index` (default) has relevance matching. The other two working indices (`products-index-popularity-asc`, `products-index-popularity-desc`) have empty `_highlightResult.matchedWords` — they are for browsing, not search.

### Two-Pass Pipeline

**Problem**: Paginated endpoint has per-store pricing but NO relevance sort. Algolia index has relevance but NO per-store pricing.

**Solution**: Two-pass pipeline using Algolia filter syntax:

```
PASS 1 (Relevance): POST /search/products/query/index/products-index
  → Returns hits with _highlightResult.matchedWords
  → Extract productID where matchedWords not empty

PASS 2 (Pricing): POST /search/paginated/products with filters
  → Filters: "productID:5101189-KGM-000 OR productID:5104350-KGM-000 ..."
  → Returns per-store singlePrice.price + promotions[].rewardValue
  → Sort: PRICE_ASC (cheapest at this store)
```

**Results for "beef mince" at Metro Auckland**:
- Pass 1: 40 hits, 40 with relevance matches
- Pass 2: 3 products with per-store pricing: $9.49, $13.49, $26.99

**Advantage over Mobile API**: Explicit relevance matching via `_highlightResult` (mobile API returns first result but no visibility into WHY it matched). Critical for ingredient search — avoids pet food matching "beef mince".

### Conclusion
**The Edge API CAN replace the mobile API** for New World:
- No dependency on mobile API endpoint
- Works with website JWT (more future-proof, same IdP: `online-customer`)
- Algolia search with explicit relevance matching + price sorting
- Per-store pricing via cookies + Algolia filters
- Promotional pricing included
- Categories endpoint available for navigation

## 28. New World store-finder page `__NEXT_DATA__` for URL slugs only

The New World store-finder page (`https://www.newworld.co.nz/store-finder`) `__NEXT_DATA__` JSON provides URL slugs for 150 stores. The JSON path is `data.props.pageProps.page.page_content.content_blocks[1].store_finder.regionStoreGroupings` → `northIsland`/`southIsland` → `groups` → `stores`. Each store has `title`, `url`, and `address`. This is used as a secondary data source to add URL slugs to the mobile API data (which provides coordinates and store IDs but no URLs).

## 29. Accept 7 New World stores without URLs

7 stores have name mismatches between the mobile API and the store-finder page (e.g., "Metro Auckland" vs "Metro Queen Street", macron differences for Tūrangi/Wanaka). Fuzzy string matching could resolve these but is not needed — URLs are only for linking to the website, not for the API-based optimizer. The 142 stores with URLs are sufficient.

## 30. New World `DISH_INGREDIENTS` map reuses Pak'nSave's

The 21 dishes and their ingredient lists are identical between Pak'nSave and New World (both are NZ supermarkets with similar product ranges). The `NewWorld_prototype.py` will reuse the same `DISH_INGREDIENTS` map from `PaknSave_prototype.py`, only changing the banner and User-Agent.

## 31. Playwright not needed for New World at runtime

The Foodstuffs mobile API provides all store data (coordinates, IDs, banner) without any browser automation. Product search will use `GET /mobile/ecomm-products/MNW/{store_id}/search?q={query}` — same pattern as Pak'nSave. No Playwright needed for any New World operation, consistent with the Woolworths approach.

## 32. Edge API Two-Pass Pipeline is the Recommended Production Path for New World

The two-pass pipeline on the Edge API is now the **recommended production architecture** for New World, superseding the mobile API approach:

| Aspect | Mobile API | Edge API (Two-Pass) |
|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Relevance matching | Implicit (first result) | Explicit `_highlightResult.matchedWords` |
| Per-store pricing | Native (storeId in URL) | Via cookies + Algolia filters |
| Price sorting | PriceAsc (limited) | PRICE_ASC, PRICE_DESC |
| Promotions | Included | Included |
| Auth | Mobile guest token | Website JWT OR mobile token |
| Dependency | Internal Foodstuffs API | Public website API (more stable) |
| Implementation complexity | Low | Medium (two passes) |
| Visibility into matches | None | Full (see matched fields) |

**Decision**: Use Edge API two-pass pipeline for new development. Keep mobile API as fallback. Update `NewWorld_prototype.py` to use Edge API in next iteration.

## 33. Pak'nSave Edge API Two-Pass Pipeline is the Recommended Production Path

The two-pass pipeline on the Edge API is now the **recommended production architecture** for Pak'nSave, superseding the mobile API approach — identical to New World:

| Aspect | Mobile API | Edge API (Two-Pass) |
|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Relevance matching | Implicit (first result) | Explicit `_highlightResult.matchedWords` |
| Per-store pricing | Native (storeId in URL) | Via cookies + Algolia filters |
| Price sorting | PriceAsc (limited) | PRICE_ASC, PRICE_DESC |
| Promotions | Included | Included |
| Auth | Mobile guest token | Website JWT OR mobile token |
| Dependency | Internal Foodstuffs API | Public website API (more stable) |
| Implementation complexity | Low | Medium (two passes) |
| Visibility into matches | None | Full (see matched fields) |
| Pet food filtering | Not available | Via `category1` in Pass 1 |

**Decision**: Use Edge API two-pass pipeline for new development. Keep mobile API as fallback. Update `PaknSave_prototype.py` to use Edge API in next iteration.

**Implementation**: `scripts/paknsave/Exploration/demo_two_pass_pipeline.py` (full demo), `test_two_pass_optimizer.py` (CLI optimizer)

## 34. Pet Food Filtering via `category1` Field

The Algolia relevance search returns pet food items (dog food, cat food) for queries like "beef mince" because the product names contain the search terms. The `category1` field in the Pass 1 response allows filtering out these items:

```python
pet_categories = {"Dog", "Cat", "Pet"}
product_ids = []
for hit in hits:
    hr = hit.get("_highlightResult", {})
    matched = [f for f, v in hr.items() if isinstance(v, dict) and v.get("matchedWords")]
    cat1 = hit.get("category1", [])
    if matched and not any(c in pet_categories for c in cat1):
        product_ids.append(hit["productID"])
```

**Decision**: Always filter by `category1` in Pass 1 to exclude pet food. This reduces relevance results but ensures only human food products are passed to Pass 2 for pricing.

**Verified**: Testing "beef mince" at PAK'nSAVE Botany — 40 hits reduced to 37 after filtering. Pet food items ("Indulge Beef Mince In Gravy Dog Food", "Mince With Beef In Gravy Cat Food") successfully excluded.

## 35. Region Cookie for South Island Stores

The `Region` cookie in the Edge API determines which store's price list is returned:
- `Region: "NI"` — North Island stores
- `Region: "SI"` — South Island stores

**Decision**: Use `Region: "NI"` for North Island stores (default) and `Region: "SI"` for South Island stores. This is determined by the store's `region` field from the store listing response.

**Note**: The mobile API does not require this cookie — it uses the store ID in the URL path to determine the region automatically. The Edge API requires explicit region context via cookies.

## 36. Edge API Returns 57 Stores vs Mobile API's 60

The Pak'nSave Edge API (`GET /v1/edge/store`) returns 57 stores, while the mobile API (`GET /mobile/store/physical`) returns 60 stores. The 3 missing stores are:

| Store Name | Store ID | City | Region | Coordinates |
|------------|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| **Wairau Road** | `002b83de-b79d-4228-a787-bd0765b6cb56` | Glenfield, Auckland | NI | -36.7789, 174.7440 |
| **Gisborne City** | `26c9c8bd-b7d8-4551-9fb0-350b829740a1` | Gisborne | NI | -38.6642, 178.0210 |
| **Levin** | `90302a32-84f3-492a-8c9a-10f5242c0448` | Levin | NI | -40.6226, 175.2877 |

**Testing**: All 3 stores return 0 products in Pass 2 (per-store pricing) despite having relevance matches in Pass 1. This confirms these stores are not configured for online ordering via the Edge API.

**Decision**: Use the Edge API store listing as the primary source (57 stores). The mobile API can be used as a fallback if more stores are needed. The 57 stores cover all major Pak'nSave locations nationwide.

**Note**: This is similar to the New World discrepancy (148 Edge API stores vs 149 mobile API stores).
