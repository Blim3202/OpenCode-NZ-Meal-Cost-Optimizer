## Key Gotchas

### Pak'nSave
- Guest API token expires after 30 min — auto-refreshed by the `PaknSaveAPI` class.
- Prices from the Pak'nSave API are in **cents** — divide by 100 for dollars.
- `PaknSaveAPI.get_stores()` returns `{"stores": [...]}`, not a bare list.
- Nominatim geocoding rate limit: 1 req/sec.
- **Edge API two-pass pipeline**: Uses website JWT (`fs-user-token` cookie) for auth — works.
- **Edge API pet food filtering**: Filter by `category1` to exclude `{"Dog", "Cat", "Pet"}` categories in Pass 1.

### New World
- Uses the same Foodstuffs mobile API as Pak'nSave with `banner: "MNW"` and `User-Agent: NewWorldApp/4.32.0`.
- Prices from the New World API are in **cents** — divide by 100 for dollars.
- 149 stores with coordinates and store IDs from the mobile API — no Nominatim geocoding needed.
- **Edge API two-pass pipeline**: Uses website JWT (`fs-user-token` cookie) for auth — works.
- 7 stores missing URLs due to name mismatches between API and store-finder page (e.g., "Metro Auckland" vs "Metro Queen Street", macron differences).

### Woolworths
- **Per-store pricing via cookie injection**: The `cw-lrkswrdjp` cookie controls store context. Construct it as `dm-Pickup,f-{fulfilmentStoreId},s-38` where `fulfilmentStoreId` = `extra1` from `woolworths_store_data.json`. See `Woolworths_API.md` section 8 for full details.
- **Fresh session required per store**: Reusing a `requests.Session` causes the server's `Set-Cookie` to overwrite the injected `cw-lrkswrdjp`. Create a new session (with `GET /`) for each store.
- **`fulfilmentStoreId` != `pickupAddressId`**: These are different numbers. Use `extra1` from `woolworths_store_data.json` for the cookie.
- **`areaId` is optional**: The cookie works with just `dm-Pickup,f-{fulfilmentStoreId}`. The `a-` and `s-` fields are not required.
- **`s-38` is constant**: Confirmed across all tested stores. Safe to hardcode.
- **x-requested-with header mandatory**: Omitting it returns HTTP 400. The literal string `"??"` works.
- **Session seeding**: A single `GET /` with browser-like headers establishes cookies. No login needed for public endpoints.
- **Playwright headless=False required**: If you do use Playwright, the site blocks headless Chromium.
- Search returns first/most-relevant result per query, not cheapest (avoids pet food for "beef mince").
- 21 dishes are hand-curated in `DISH_INGREDIENTS` — no NLP/LLM parsing yet.

## Woolworths Research Status

- **Per-store pricing CONFIRMED**: The `cw-lrkswrdjp` cookie controls store context. Different stores return different prices (e.g., Greymouth Milk 3L = $7.15, Glenfield = $7.33). 21/21 products show price differences between stores.
- **Playwright NOT needed at runtime**: The `cw-lrkswrdjp` cookie can be constructed from `extra1` in `woolworths_store_data.json` (verified 3/3 stores). No browser automation needed for product search or store switching.
- **`woolworths_api.py` module built and tested**: End-to-end pipeline working — geocode address, find nearby stores, inject per-store cookies, search products, compare costs. See `scripts/woolworths/woolworths_api.py`.
- **Fresh session per store required**: The server's `Set-Cookie` response overwrites injected cookies on reused sessions. Each store needs a fresh `requests.Session`.
- **All 67 cookies unnecessary**: Only `cw-lrkswrdjp` carries store context. The other 66 cookies (session_state, RT, Akamai, analytics, ads) are not needed for API calls.
- **`areaId` not in any data source**: The `a-field` in the cookie is optional and would require Playwright to capture per-store. Not needed for per-store pricing.
- **Full API documentation**: `Woolworths_API.md` (1290+ lines) covers all endpoints, cookie architecture, and production usage.

## New World Research Status

- **Per-store pricing CONFIRMED**: Native per-store pricing via store ID in URL path — no cookie tricks needed (unlike Woolworths). Different stores return different prices (e.g., beef mince: $9.49 at Shore City vs $26.99 at Metro Auckland).
- **Mobile API working**: `api-prod.prod.fsniwaikato.kiwi/prod` with `banner: "MNW"` and `User-Agent: NewWorldApp/4.32.0` returns 149 stores with coordinates and store IDs.
- **No Nominatim geocoding needed**: All 149 stores have coordinates from the mobile API — eliminates the 22 stores that were missing coordinates via Nominatim.
- **New World Edge API — TWO-PASS PIPELINE WORKS**:
  - The Edge API does NOT have a single endpoint with both relevance matching AND per-store pricing. We discovered a **two-pass architecture**:
  
  **PASS 1 — Relevance Matching (Algolia Index):**
  - `POST /v1/edge/search/products/query/index/products-index` (the DEFAULT Algolia index)
  - Returns hits with `_highlightResult.matchedWords` — explicit relevance matching!
  - Fields matched: `DisplayName`, `category2AndBrand`, `category1`, `category2`, `brand`, etc.
  - Sort: Algolia default (relevance)
  - Price: `averagePrice` (cross-store, not per-store)
  
  **PASS 2 — Per-Store Pricing (Paginated Endpoint with Filters):**
  - `POST /v1/edge/search/paginated/products` with Algolia `filters` parameter
  - Filter syntax: `productID:xxx OR productID:yyy OR productID:zzz`
  - Returns `singlePrice.price` (cents) + `promotions[].rewardValue` (promo cents)
  - Sort: `PRICE_ASC`, `PRICE_DESC` (no RELEVANCE sort available)
  - Store context via cookies: `eCom_STORE_ID`, `STORE_ID_V2`, `Region`
  
  **Algolia Indices Tested (14+):**
  - `products-index` ✅ 200 — DEFAULT, relevance sorted, HAS `_highlightResult`
  - `products-index-popularity-asc` ✅ 200 — NO relevance matches, popularity ASC
  - `products-index-popularity-desc` ✅ 200 — NO relevance matches, popularity DESC
  - All others (`price-asc`, `price-desc`, `relevance`, `name-asc`, `name-desc`, `newest`, `bestselling`, `trending`) ❌ 404
  
  **Key Discovery**: Only the DEFAULT `products-index` has relevance matching via `_highlightResult`. The popularity indices have the field but it's EMPTY.
  
  **Bridge**: Pass 1 extracts `productID` from hits with non-empty `matchedWords`. Pass 2 uses Algolia `filters` to get per-store pricing for exactly those relevant products.
  
  **Advantage over Mobile API**: Explicit relevance matching (mobile API returns first result but no visibility into WHY it matched). Critical for avoiding pet food matching "beef mince".
  
- **Store listing**: `GET /v1/edge/store` — 148 stores (HTTP 200)
- **Categories**: `GET /v1/edge/store/{id}/categories` — works
- **Auth**: Website JWT (from `POST /api/user/get-current-user` → `fs-user-token` cookie) OR mobile API token
- **Store context**: Cookies `eCom_STORE_ID`, `STORE_ID_V2`, `Region`
- **Sort**: `PRICE_ASC`, `PRICE_DESC`
- **Edge API can fully replace mobile API** — no dependency on Foodstuffs mobile endpoint
- **7 stores missing URLs**: Name mismatches between API and store-finder page (e.g., "Metro Auckland" vs "Metro Queen Street", macron differences). URLs are only for website linking, not for the API optimizer.
- **Full API documentation**: `NewWorld_API.md` covers all endpoints, auth flow, per-store pricing, two-pass pipeline, and production usage.
- **`NewWorld_prototype.py` built and tested**: End-to-end pipeline working — geocode address, find nearby stores, search products, compare costs. 21 dishes supported.
- **Two-pass pipeline implementation**: `scripts/newworld/Exploration/explore_edge_api9_relevance.py` (comprehensive), `test_milk_metro_relevance.py` (focused test), `demo_edge_optimizer.py` (full optimizer demo).

## Pak'nSave Research Status

- **Per-store pricing CONFIRMED**: Native per-store pricing via store ID in URL path — no cookie tricks needed. Different stores return different prices.
- **Mobile API working**: `api-prod.prod.fsniwaikato.kiwi/prod` with `banner: "PNS"` and `User-Agent: PAKnSAVEApp/4.32.0` returns 60 stores with coordinates and store IDs.
- **Pak'nSave Edge API — TWO-PASS PIPELINE WORKS**:
  - Same architecture as New World Edge API (identical Foodstuffs backend)
  
  **PASS 1 — Relevance Matching (Algolia Index):**
  - `POST /v1/edge/search/products/query/index/products-index` (DEFAULT Algolia index)
  - Returns hits with `_highlightResult.matchedWords` — explicit relevance matching!
  - **Key Difference from New World**: ALL three working indices have `matchedWords` populated (not just the default)
  
  **PASS 2 — Per-Store Pricing (Paginated Endpoint with Filters):**
  - `POST /v1/edge/search/paginated/products` with Algolia `filters` parameter
  - Same syntax as New World: `productID:xxx OR productID:yyy`
  - Returns `singlePrice.price` (cents) + `promotions[].rewardValue` (promo cents)
  - Sort: `PRICE_ASC`, `PRICE_DESC`
  - Store context via cookies: `eCom_STORE_ID`, `STORE_ID_V2`, `Region`
  
  **Pet Food Filtering**: Filter by `category1` to exclude `{"Dog", "Cat", "Pet"}` categories in Pass 1. Critical for queries like "beef mince" which return pet food items.
  
- **Store listing**: `GET /v1/edge/store` — 57 stores (HTTP 200) — 3 fewer than mobile API's 60. Missing stores: Wairau Road (Glenfield), Gisborne City, Levin (not configured for Edge API ordering).
- **Auth**: Website JWT (from `POST /api/user/get-current-user` → `fs-user-token` cookie) OR mobile API token
- **Store context**: Cookies `eCom_STORE_ID`, `STORE_ID_V2`, `Region` (NI or SI for South Island)
- **Sort**: `PRICE_ASC`, `PRICE_DESC`
- **Edge API can fully replace mobile API** — no dependency on Foodstuffs mobile endpoint
- **Full API documentation**: `PaknSave_API.md` section 6 covers all endpoints, auth flow, per-store pricing, two-pass pipeline, and production usage.
- **Two-pass pipeline implementation**: `scripts/paknsave/Exploration/demo_two_pass_pipeline.py` (full demo), `test_two_pass_optimizer.py` (CLI optimizer), `Exploration.md` (full documentation).
